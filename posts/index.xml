			<description>Taming thoughts &amp;amp; emotions In my understanding the only way to tame them is a twofold one :
accept &amp;amp; invite whatever arises listen to them and let them disappear ! if I chase or flee they might get stuck in my psyche and in my body ! Circulation only goes smooth whenever I welcome &amp;amp; feel through anything coming up from my deep deep soul or void, without becoming this newcomer, meaning If I resist or identify with it, my flow might get stuck what if I just caught myself resisting one or perhaps identifying with another?</description>

In my understanding the only way to tame them is a twofold one :<br>
accept &amp; invite whatever arises
listen to them and let them disappear
! if I chase or flee they might get stuck in my psyche and in my body !
Circulation only goes smooth whenever I welcome &amp; feel through anything coming up from my deep deep soul or void, without becoming this newcomer,
meaning If I resist or identify with it, my flow might get stuck
what if I just caught myself resisting one or perhaps identifying with another?
Step back &amp; gently observe this process; you might want to whisper to yourself „I am experiencing this.”</p>

			<description>What is progress? Am I improving? Where do I go?
Some of our greatest minds lost their ways in the process of self-realization, stuck in a place where they have to constantly prove that they are worthy enough thus earning a right to exist. The endless search for approval could work as a barrier in their path. (isn’t it like licking your wound to heal it, but your tongue is too rough and ripping the surface again?</description>

<p>Some of our greatest minds lost their ways in the process of self-realization, stuck in a place where they have to constantly prove that they are worthy enough thus earning a right to exist. The endless search for approval could work as a barrier in their path. (isn’t it like licking your wound to heal it, but your tongue is too rough and ripping the surface again?)
Don’t get me wrong: wanting to improve is a wonderful human trait. However it can be overdone in a way that eventually it might backfire and start poisioning. The engine for growing became corrupt and started handicapping itself.</p>
<p>Do you know someone like that? 
Think about what could be the cause?</p>
<p>Perhaps some undigested emotional charges from the past? Or is it the competitive individualistic culture of our time? The craving for constant growth? (But wait what If I don’t want to be a tumour)</p>
<p>What could help that person to outgrow their old habit? 
Is there a part of me which resembles that? How to heal it? Accept it? Integrate it? Can I contain my fears and desires? Do I have the capacity to hold my perfectly unperfect self? To treat every step of the journey as it is, leaving dualism of good &amp; evil behind.</p>
<p>What is the barrier between me and my unleashed potential right now? What could be the next step towards this destination?</p>

			<description>In this day and world it&amp;rsquo;s easy to focus on things/experiences which you don&amp;rsquo;t have. Let&amp;rsquo;s go against the main-stream &amp;amp; look into what you already have. Gratitude is the state of being grateful; a positive emotional state in which one recognizes and appreciates all the wonders what one has received. Research shows, that taking time to experience gratitude or thankfulness can make you happier &amp;amp; both physically and emotionally healthier.</description>

Gratitude is the state of being grateful; a positive emotional state in which one recognizes and appreciates all the wonders what one has received. Research shows, that taking time to experience gratitude or thankfulness can make you happier &amp; both physically and emotionally healthier.</p>
<p>Take a moment to recall the last time you practiced gratitude. Let&rsquo;s continue this practice now and give 5 minutes to think about all the things you can be grateful for at this moment. They can be little - even minoculus - things/mundane, everday experiences or huge stuff/rare events. The point is to bring those to your mind and actively exercise being grateful.</p>
<p>How does it feel in your body? Any emotions came along?</p>
<p>If you liked it, you could practice it on a daily/weekly/whatever suits you basis. You might feel like writing down a list about all the things you are grateful for, you could even place the list in a place visible for you.<br>
Other way to pratice gratitude is to think about someone who you have not expressed your honest gratitude to lately and do it! The best if you can do it in person but it&rsquo;s ok to videochat/call/write/etc.</p>
